HW Week 15:  Plotly Challenge

Objective:  Create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset.

Steps:  
* Create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in a particular individual sample.
* Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
* Display an individual sample's metadata (i.e., demographic information such as ethnicity, age, gender, etc.)
* (Optional) Create a gauge chart to plot the weekly BB washing frequency of the individual.

All charts will update when a new sample is selected.
