# Belly Button Biodiversity: Interactive Visualizations with Plotly


Objective:  Create an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset and create visualizations with Plotly.

Visualizations on this interactive dashboard include:  
* A horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 OTUs found in the selected sample.
* A bubble chart that displays each sample.
* The individual sample's metadata (i.e., demographic information such as ethnicity, age, gender, etc.)
* A gauge chart to plot the weekly belly button washing frequency of the individual.

All visualizations will update when a new sample is selected.
